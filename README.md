# Group 1 Python Assignment

This repository contains group work for practicing **Python functions** and **Git collaboration**.

## Tasks
1. **Speed Checker**  
   Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input.  
   - If speed < 70 → print `"Ok"`.  
   - For every 5 km/s above 70 → add 1 demerit point.  
   - If points > 12 → print `"License suspended"`.

   - NSSF deductions  
   - Gross salary

## Collaboration Guide
- Each task has its own branch (`task1`, `task2`, `task3`).  
- Create feature branches when working on changes (e.g., `readme-update`).  
- Commit and push regularly.  
- Open a pull request (PR) to merge into `main`.  
- Review each other’s work before merging.
